		<h2>Entry 5 - Benny's List 4: Dynamicism!</h2>
		
		<p>This one took a bit of thinking. I had a couple of speed bumps, namely getting Handlebars on the server to recognise a template (solved by pointing HB to the correct directory) and Node complaining about error codes when responding with the 404 page (solved by sending the 404 in the handler instead of passing to <code>next()</code> )</p>
		<p>Again, <a href="https://devdocs.io">devdocs.io</a> was infinetly useful for its consolidation of all the different references, including express and npm. Good stuff.</p>

		<h2>Entry 4 - Benny's List 3: The Servening</h2>

		<p>Even easier money. Banged this one out in an hour. I am already familiar with Node and how to read files, etc; the http module was easy enough to figure out after a trip to the Node docs.</p>
		<p>Caching was trivial to set up. Using a map allowed me to easily use the filepath to look up the page. Reading in the files as a raw Buffer allowed the server to handle both the text files and the image without special cases since none of the files are being modified.</p>

		<h2>Entry 3 - Benny's List 2: Interactive Boogaloo</h2>

		<p>Easy money. Getting the filtering to work multiple times while still removing elements from the DOM was tricky, until I realized you can clone a DOM node into an array and then remove the original from the page.</p>
		<p>As always, the MDN was great for looking up documentation for all this. Found a site <a href="https://devdocs.io">devdocs.io</a> that serves as a frontend for the MDN and allows for easy searching. Useful!</p>

		<h2>Entry 2 - Benny's List</h2>

		<p>This one wasn't too bad, but there were a couple of things that gave me trouble. Getting the results to the right of the filter box took some experimenting with absolute positioning, since I didn't find an easy way to position it relative to the filter box. The filter box itself was the hardest part for me. Getting the input fields to be on the same line as the labels wasn't bad, that was just setting them both to be inline elements. Trying to shrink the input fields to fit the width of the box stumped me for about an hour, since I didn't want to just maually specify a specific pixel width. I ended up using a flex-box to be able to have each input field be able to grow to fit the available width. the MDN had a couple of examples for how to set up a flexbox that were useful.</p>

		<h2>Entry 1 - First Assignment</h2>

		<p>This assignment didn't give me too much trouble. Between the MDN HTML skeleton and the setup we went over in class, getting the head and favicon setup was easy. I did have some trouble with file permissions on <code>flip</code> where the images in <code>pictures/</code> were unreadable by me. Re-cloning the repo fixed it, so I've not a clue what caused that.</p>
		<p>For resources used, I grabbed the skeleton HTML (how to set up the head and favicon) from MDN; the other stuff I either knew or learned in class.</p>
